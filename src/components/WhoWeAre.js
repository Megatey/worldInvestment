            Shell was formed in 1907, although our history can be traced back to

            <h2> Our purpose </h2>Shellâ€™s
            purpose is to power progress together by providing more and cleaner
            energy solutions. We believe that rising standards of living for a
            growing global population are likely to continue to drive demand for
            energy, including oil and gas, for years to come. At the same time,
            the need to tackle climate change means there is a global transition
            under way to a low-carbon energy system.

          <h2>   Our people </h2> people are essential to the successful delivery of
            the Shell strategy and to sustaining business performance over the
            long term. Performing competitively in the evolving energy landscape
            requires competent and empowered people working safely together
            across Shell. We believe that diverse teams led by inclusive leaders
            deliver better safety and business performance.
